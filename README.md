# HyskyAPI
Unofficial Hypixel API created for handling Auctions API of Skyblock gamemode with ease and efficiency.

## Facts about the API:
- All auctions are updated every 5 minutes.
- Auctions' limit per request is 200.
- All auctions are sorted automatically to show the ending soon one's first.

## An auction example:

https://i.ibb.co/prTTTFv/example.png

- "item_name" => Item's name
- "starting_bid" => Start Bid
- "highest_bid_amount" => Highest Bid
- "category" => Item's category
- "bid_num" => Number of bid on Item
- "Latest_bid => Array includes info about latest bidder
- "tier" => Item's tier (Legendary)
- "end" => Ending time in UNIX
- "highest" => (for server side sorting)
- "auctioneer" => uuid of auction's owner
- "item_lore" => item's description including mincraft color codes
- "uuid" => Profile's id (Hypixel)
- "ending_time" => Ending time in minutes
- "item_count" => Amount of item(s)
- "anvils" => Anvil Uses
- "hex_code" => Color code for the item

## API's root:

The Api root is https://s.hyskyapi.cc/apihandle.php

### There are 2 types of requests:
- req=top **To get top 200 auctions.**
- req=search **to Search through Auctions and needs a query.**

so for example let's say you want to search for "aspect of the end" <br>
https://s.hyskyapi.cc/apihandle.php?req=search&query=aspectoftheend <br>
This will return 200 AOTEs auctions sorted by ending time (This searches through all active skyblock auctions).
<br>
<br>
but what if you want more?
<br>
https://s.hyskyapi.cc/apihandle.php?req=search&query=aspectoftheend&page=1
<br>
This will return the next 200 AOTE auctions.

### Notes:
- Page value's default is 0.
- You can do "/ah (Player username)" in the query parameter to get the auctions of a player, Just like in game.
- You can replace "aspectoftheend" with just "aote" in the query parameter and it will be the same result.
- Checkout some shortcuts to some items that you can use in the query parameter here: https://skyah.cc/smart
- If you search by default it will sort by ending soon only, no sorting options added yet.
- You can search for enchanted books and items using /ebs (enchants)
  - Example: https://s.hyskyapi.cc/apihandle.php?req=search&query=/ebs%20power5&page=1
- /ebs is typically used to search for enchants, but you can also use it to search for item's lore instead of item's name in query parameter.
